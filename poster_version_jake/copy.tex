A `system' can roughly be thought of as a set of points and a map that moves those points around.

Figure 3 depicts the components of a cone in $\R^3$. To investigate the structure of cones this project looked at adjacency between facets. Two facets are {\bf adjacent} if their intersection is a cone in a codimension  $2$ subspace. This is equivalent to two facets being adjacent if for their facet normals $f_1$ and $f_2$, the  orthogonal complement of their sum ($f_1+f_2$) intersected with the original cone has codimension $2$. This is a result of a dimension theorem implying that

\vspace{-1.5cm} $$\text{span}\{F_1\cap F_2\} = \text{span}\{F_1\} \cap \text{span}\{F_2\}.$$

\large{It is clear that in our cone generated by triangles, there are finitely many facets all of which are determined uniquely by their facet normals. Using programming tools we have made a relatively efficient algorithm for classifying the facets by their normals. We have done the calculations for $n=5,6,7, \text{ and }8$, in which there are $10$, $70$, $897$ and, $52367$ facets  respectively. However, the number of facets on these cones grow extremely fast and quickly become impractical; when $n=9$ we have a list of facets that seems to be complete but remains to be proven. }

\begin{textblock}{6}(8.4,8.78)
\large{It is important to note that there are isomorphism classes between facets, stemming from redundancy of vertex labeling.

\large{
For any $n>5$ every unit vector $u = (0,...,0,1,0,...,0)$ orthogonal complement that satisfies the requirements of a facet. We call these facets the {\bf trivial facets}. Computational evidence suggests that for $n>5$ every facet is adjacent to a trivial facet. The main goal of this research was to take steps in proving that all facets are adjacent to a trivial facet for $n>5$.
}

\large{
Every facet $F$ induces a graph of {\bf trivial adjacencies}, a graph that is the sum all the normals to trivial facets adjacent to $F$. Figure 5 shows the adjacency graphs of the facets shown in figure 4.

\LARGEhead{Results of the project}

\large{ Through the adjacency graph computations we have come to the qualitative conclusion that it seems as if every facet is adjacent to a trivial facet.  Though the proof is not complete, we have proved that it is true in many cases. Before we lay out the cases it must be noted that a facet normal $f$ ``vanishes" on a triangle vector $t$ if $f \cdot t = 0$, i.e. the sum of the edges where $t$ is 1 in $f$ is $0$. 
}

\large{ {\bf Case 1: } If we are in the situation of a facet normal $f$ with an edge $e$ that is in only one vanishing triangle then $f$ has a trivial adjacency. \\
}
\large{ {\bf Proof: } Let $e$ be the edge in a facet normal $f$ that is contained in only one vanishing triangle. Let $u$ be the trivial facet normal which has a $1$ in the place of $e$. Then since the vanishing triangle containing $e$ is not a linear combination of the other vanishing triangles, the dimension of the orthogonal complement to $u+f$ intersected with the cone must have decreased, and furthermore it must only have decreased by $1$ since $u+f$ has only one less vanishing triangle to $f$, and thus $f$ is adjacent to $u$.  \hfill $\square$
}

\large{{\bf Lemma 2: } If $e$ is an edge in a facet normal $f$ and $e$ is contained in two vanishing triangles then there is an edge $a$ in $f$ such that comparing the values $w_a,w_e$ of $a$ and $e$ we have $w_a \geq w_e$ \\ 
}
\large{{\bf Proof: }  Without loss of generality, let $e = \{1,2\}$ and let the vanishing triangles be $\{1,2,3\}$ and $\{1,2,4\}$. Then  $2w_e+w_{13}+w_{14}+w_{23}+w_{24} = 0$.  Considering $a=\{3,4\}$, we must have also that $2w_a+w_{13}+w_{14}+w_{23}+w_{24} \geq 0$ as there are no negative triangles in the facet.  Therefore, the weight of $\{3,4\}$ is at least the weight of $\{1,2\}$. \hfill $\square$
}

\large{{\bf Case 2: } If we are in the situation of a facet normal $f$ such that every edge is in at least $4$ vanishing triangles then $f$ has a trivial adjacency. \\
}
\large{{\bf Proof Tool:}  Assume that we have $e = \{1,2\}$ of maximum weight (assume $w_e = 2$), and that $a_1 = \{3,4\}$, $a_2=\{4,5\}$, $a_3=\{5,6\}$    and $a_4 = \{3,6\}$ are edges of maximum weight derived by the same method as the proof of lemma 2. Then via some simple linear algebra computations since $a_i$ and $e$ have maximum weight $w_{13}=w_{23}=...= w_{16}=w_{26} = -1$. Figure 6 depicts the results.}

\large{This octohedron give us the sum also depicted in figure 6 where we can construct one triangle from the other triangles in the octohedron. This gives that, upon incramention of $a_1$ in the facet (as in case 1), we don't lose more then $1$ dimension implying a trivial adjacency. \hfill $\square$

\begin{textblock}{5.5}(16.8,11.1)
\large{Not restricting to these two cases, what happens in an arbitrary graph that has every edge in at least two vanishing triangle is still an open question. It seems from the data that most facets fall into these two cases. However, figure 7 gives examples of facet normals that don't. The cases at least give a characterization of adjacency structure. Future research should 
look both at the further simplification of the cone via adjacencies and at the application of the cone to the Nash-Williams conjecture.
